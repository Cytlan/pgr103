// Challenge text:
//     We are having a party with amounts of tea and candy (two int variables).
//     Return the int outcome of the party encoded as 0=bad, 1=good, or 2=great.
//     A party is good (1) if both tea and candy are at least 5.
//     However, if either tea or candy is at least double the amount of the other one, the party is great (2).
//     However, in all cases, if either tea or candy is less than 5, the party is always bad (0).
//
// Challenge example:
//     teaParty(6, 8) → 1
//     teaParty(3, 8) → 0
//     teaParty(20, 6) → 2
